# Food Recipe App 🍜

A very simple demo for a food recipe search app created with React JS and Tailwind CSS.
Get's data from forkify API (https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2), you can save/remove any recipe in "favorites" (but won't store any data on a DB yet).


Just a simple exercise I did to practice a bit more the react-router-dom library.
